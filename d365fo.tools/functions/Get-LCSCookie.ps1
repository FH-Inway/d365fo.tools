# Selenium seems to be the defacto standard for browser automation, but it is not available for PowerShell directly.
# We can either write our own Selenium WebDriver wrapper in PowerShell or use one of the existing PowerShell modules.
# The ones I found do not seem to have been maintained in the last 3 years, so there is a good chance they will not work.
# We should investigate both ways and see which one works best for us.
# Existing modules:

# PowerShell does not have a direct equivalent to Selenium, but you can use Internet Explorer COM object for automation
$ie = New-Object -ComObject 'internetExplorer.Application'
$ie.Visible = $true

# Navigate to the URL
$url = 'http://localhost:4455/wd/hub'
$ie.Navigate($url)

# Wait for the page to load
while ($ie.Busy -eq $true) { Start-Sleep -Seconds 1 }

# Find elements and interact with them
# PowerShell does not have a direct equivalent to Selenium's By class, so you need to use the methods provided by the COM object
$signInLink = $ie.Document.getElementsByClassName('lnkAnkr') | Select-Object -First 1
$signInLink.click()

# Wait for the page to load
while ($ie.Busy -eq $true) { Start-Sleep -Seconds 1 }

# Continue with the rest of the elements...
